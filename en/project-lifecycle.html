					<h2>The main competence</h2>
					<h3>in a project management.</h3>
					
					<p>The next stages of our cooperation are possible if a customer considers using all advantages of working with consulting company as a single contractor. 
					In this case, our competence in the project management comes forward. But for overcoming all possible risks and limitations which take place during project realization, 
					the additional specific knowledge (interaction with producer, designer and integration companies) is demanded, 
					besides the existing common experience which is needed for the management of resourses, time and finance. </p>
					
					<h3>The stage of preparation of technical solution</h3>

					<ul>
						<li>The functional and budget requirements for existing or created system are not always clearly formulated.</li>
						<li>There is not enough information about the latest technological innovations and achievements.</li>
						<li>The competence level of technical specialists responsible for developing and making decisions is insufficient.</li>
					</ul>

					
					<h3>Stage of production</h3>
					
					<ul>
						<li>The elaboration terms of demanded product are rather high, which depends on the competence of marketers and engineers.</li>
						<li>The production time is determined by the planning and technological characteristics of production.</li>
						<li>There are regional specifics in prices and market and sale policy of vendor.</li>

					</ul>

					<h3>Stage of designing</h3>

					<ul>
						<li>There is incoherence in the process of cooperation with producer. Using out of date technical decisions, as well as equipment that have gone out of production.</li>
						<li>There is insufficient accounting of economic side of project.</li>
						<li>The qualification and experience of the technical specialists in the realization of complex project is insufficient.</li>
					
					</ul>
				

					<h3>The stage of equipment supply</h3>

					<ul>
						<li>Additional problem – the increase of project budget due to a failure in providing discount on equipment from producer, distributor, as well as integrator.</li>
					</ul>


					<h3>Stage of installation and commissioning</h3>

					<ul>
						<li>Insufficient level of technical competence at the stage of design (if integrator takes this job) as well as during commissioning.</li>
						<li>The possible change of the technical solution or equipment, if financial support of project is not enough.</li>
						<li>The faults which take place during installation and commissioning, especially when separate subsystems are joined to central structure under control of specialized software.</li>
						<li>The main risk at this stage is incoherence in actions of producer, distributor, integrator during the implementation of complex project, especially if it consists of several subsystems.</li>
					</ul>
