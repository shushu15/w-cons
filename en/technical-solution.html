					<h2>Optimal technical solution</h2>

<p>Before all, there is the Terms of Reference (TOR) as the base for the future job. It should not be overloaded by needless technical characteristics, which sometimes are copy-pasted from internet datasheets. 
The TOR must distinctly reflect the requirements for the system by listing of the main technical characteristics, functions and system structure. Each kind of system is specific, 
for example, for creation of fire alarm and voice evacuation systems (VAS) the customer’s desire is not enough, nearly the all system composition is defined in accordance with norm requirements. 
For the access system it is necessary to understand who to let in and where. The video surveillance system is somewhere in between them, 
the same result can be obtained by using different approaches to choosing and setting cameras. 
It is the designer’s skills and talents to optimize the solution as well as keep required functionality. </p>

<p>The second component is preparation of Technical Commercial Offer (TCO) for equipment. 
In accordance with TOR, the equipment is defined: sensors, cameras, readers, central management devices, data storage and monitoring, 
as well as required management software, licenses and possible upgrade.</p>

<p>The third component is initial cost of materials and work (including design work). 
This component is optional, because it has relative accuracy, but if customer needs it for a budget evaluation, it could be prepared. 
Of course, the accurate estimation of the budget will be possible, when the whole design work is done and all required materials such as cables, trays, trunks are taken into account.</p>

<p>Optional, we can provide expert review of our offer on behalf of the producer, whose equipment we use. 
Of course, such report fully reflects our competence and the level of work with given tasks.</p>
