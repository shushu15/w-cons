					<h2>How does it work?</h2>
					
					<p>Our job starts from the meeting with a customer. During the first meeting, we try to receive from them all possible information, for example:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>What they expect from this system, the reasons for its creation</li>
						<li>If this system is created from the scratch, or it is a modernization or expansion of the existing one</li>
						<li>If they have an experience in creating and operating similar systems</li>
						<li>If they have got staff, who are necessary for the system creation</li>
						<li>If there is the understanding of budget and it’s rationale, which customer has to use in this project</li>
						<li>If there are some preferences for choosing a producer</li>
						<li>If this system is complex or separate</li>
						<li>Desired timeframe for the project</li>
					</ul>
					<p>If it’s possible we get the floor plans, landscape plan, make initial inspection of the object. 
					Based on this we suggest to sign a contract for preparing the technical solution for creating the system. 
					For the period of this job we begin working as part-time personnel of customer’s company, understanding all the details of their requirements, 
					collecting and analyzing all the possible information. According to this information we offer the technical solution.</p>
