					<h2>Our possibilities: kinds of engineering systems and applied equipment:</h2>
					<ul>
					<li><strong> IT-systems. </strong> First of all, SCS (Structured cable systems) and trays, trunks, enclosures etc., as well as equipment for creating of Data Centers, 
					control systems for intellectual SCS, cooling and UPS (Uninterrupted Power Supply). Also the equipment for data processing and transmitting: 
					switches, routers, IP and traditional office PABX, WiFi devices, etc.</li>
					<li><strong>Security and Safety systems. </strong> - 
						The first includes video surveillance systems, intrusion alarm systems, perimeter protection, access control systems including different kinds of barriers, gates, parking systems, intercom systems: 
						in general, everything related to the control and restriction of the unauthorized entry and movement of people and vehicles in the protected area. 
						In addition, CCTV stopped being just security a long time ago, and it is used in manufacture, so-called technological video, as well as in the other spheres 
						(due to improved image quality and digital processing). There is also the quite specific inspection equipment.</li>
					<li><strong>Safety systems</strong> don’t restrict and don’t track physical access to protected area, 
					they only protect human life from exposure to hazardous environments primarily from fire. They include fire alarm systems, 
					different kinds of firefighting systems (water, powder, gas) and warning announcement and evacuation systems (Public Address). They include as well dispatchers’ communication systems and 
					loudspeakers for notification.</li>
					<li><strong>Multimedia systems</strong> are provided to create various entertainment and musical transmissions, there are the architectural lighting systems, video conferencing systems, 
					conference and language distribution systems etc.  </li>
					<li><strong>Systems of automatization </strong> of technological processes and control of building engineering systems (BMS and HVAC) – 
					these are various controllers and SCADA systems (Software for dispatcher and automatization). </li>
					<ul>
